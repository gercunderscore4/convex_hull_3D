convex_hull_3D
==============

3D convex hull algorithm


Time complexity:  O(n^2*log(n))

Space complexity: O(n)


Most algorithms I've come across have been very complicated, this one seems pretty simple, I thought it up myself.


Implemented in MATLAB/Octave, Python (2.7), andC/C++.

TODO:
- Test and debugging (3D graphics in MATLAB and Python have depth problems, so I need CPP).

KNOWN ISSUES:
- The's a problem in dealing with non-triangular facets. I have a soluton, I just need to implement it.
- Only the CPP version is up-to-date. I'll update the rest when I've finished debugging.

There's no license because I want to let people freely copy, modify, and improve it without any license. If you do improve it, please let me know.
